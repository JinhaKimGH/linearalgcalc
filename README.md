Welcome to LinearAlgCalc!

This repository is mainly used to display the sourcecode utilized for my library.

This library is built to simplify linear algebra calculations.

There are three main classes in this library: Complex numbers, Vectors, and Complex Vectors which all simplify the
linear algebra calculations. Each class has methods which are the operations and equations that it can be used with.

For example, the Complex numbers class has the 'conjugate' method which calculates and returns the complex conjugate of a complex number.

This library can be installed through pip with the command 'pip install linearalgcalc==0.1.0'
